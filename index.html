			<div class="bbb">I'm excited to attend this session since I've been working with React for a year and have found it to be a really strong framework for developing good apps (Data migration and others). So I'd like to keep honing my React abilities and working on additional projects to gain more experience and advance my career opportunities.</div>

			<div class="ccc">
				I'd want to shine in React's strong features, such as Injecting props and managing states, Hooks, Linking and Routing, JSX syntax, reusability features (HOC,...), Handling events, working with APIs, and dealing with Component Lifecycle methods and many more.
